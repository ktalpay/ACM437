# IoT Training Resources (Yeditepe University)

This repository contains educational materials, sample codes, and documentation developed for ACM 437 (Internet of Things) course at Yeditepe University. The aim is to provide students and enthusiasts with hands-on experience using Raspberry Pi and Arduino platforms.

## Purpose

The materials in this repository were used in lab sessions and workshops to:
- Teach the fundamentals of IoT using Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
- Provide practical examples of GPIO operations, LED control, sensor integration, and basic automation.
- Encourage experimentation with hardware and software integration.

## Contents

- `tek_led.py` — Simple Raspberry Pi GPIO control example for blinking a single LED.
- `uclu_led.py` — Raspberry Pi example for controlling three LEDs (red, yellow, green) in sequence.
- `docs/` —  
  - `RASPBERRY_PI_ILE_LED_YAKIP_SONDURME_(BLINK).pdf` — Tutorial on single LED blink project.  
  - `RASPBERRY_PI_ILE_RGB_LED_YAKIP_SONDURME_(BLINK).pdf` — RGB LED blink project guide.  
  - `iot_1_introduction.pptx` — Slide deck introducing IoT, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino fundamentals.  
- `ARDUINO_ILE_SICAKLIK_NEM_SENSORU_BAGLANTI_SEMASI.png` — Circuit diagram for Arduino temperature/humidity sensor integration.  
- `RASPBERRY_PI_ILE_SICAKLIK_NEM_SENSORU_BAGLANTI_SEMASI.fzz` — Fritzing file for Raspberry Pi temperature/humidity sensor wiring.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
